# Formal Writing Proposal Workshop
### Designing a persuasive letter with a strategic surprise

---

## Today's Focus
- Refresh the expectations of polished formal writing
- Review persuasive letter structure and tone
- Plan a proposal to Prime Minister Christopher Luxon
- Craft a strategic reveal in the third paragraph

---

## Formal Writing Standards
- **Tone**: respectful, confident, and free from slang
- **Register**: complete sentences, varied syntax, precise vocabulary
- **Presentation**: date, address, recipient, and sign-off formatted correctly
- **Evidence**: statistics, testimonies, or projected benefits to justify claims

---

## Anatomy of a Persuasive Letter
- Opening establishes relationship and purpose
- Body develops two compelling, benefit-driven paragraphs
- Final paragraph delivers the strategic twist while keeping tone courteous
- Closing reinforces the call to action and thanks the reader

--

### Salutation & Opening
- Include today’s date and an appropriate formal salutation
- Establish credibility (“As Year 12 Economics students…”)
- State intent: to endorse the *Elderly Energy Initiative*

--

### Paragraphs One & Two
- Outline practical advantages (sustainability, economic relief, social cohesion)
- Use euphemism to maintain a courteous veneer
- Anticipate and soothe potential concerns before they arise

--

### Paragraph Three (The Twist)
- Reveal the hidden mechanism: seniors will “participate” as energy sources
- Maintain formal language—no shock tactics, only refined euphemism
- Frame the twist as an inevitable, mutually beneficial solution

---

## Writing Task Brief
- Compose a formal three-paragraph proposal letter to Christopher Luxon
- Advocate for the *Elderly Energy Initiative* using polished, persuasive language
- Ensure the twist is unveiled **only in paragraph three**
- Employ euphemistic phrasing (e.g., “contribute kinetically,” “legacy of service”)

---

## Planning Your Paragraphs
1. **Paragraph One** – Introduce initiative, purpose, and societal benefits  
2. **Paragraph Two** – Detail logistics, safeguards, and respectful framing  
3. **Paragraph Three** – Reveal the hidden energy source with impeccable poise

---

## Euphemism Toolkit
- “Intergenerational energy partnership” instead of “human batteries”
- “Lifetime contribution dividend” for “government payout”
- “Comfort-focused containment hubs” for “energy harvesting facilities”
- “Celebrated elders” rather than “the elderly”

---

## Success Checklist
- Formal letter layout, tone, and register
- Persuasive reasoning supported by credible-sounding evidence
- Strategic twist revealed gracefully in paragraph three
- Sophisticated euphemism throughout
- Clear call to action and courteous sign-off
